## Income Tax Records

**Name:** 1999-2015 U.S. Income Tax Records by ZIP Code

**Data Citation:** Internal Revenue Service. (2017). 1999-2015 Individual Income Tax ZIP Code Data [Data files, user guide and record layout]. Retrieved from [https://www.irs.gov/statistics/soi-tax-stats-individual-income-tax-statistics-zip-code-data-soi](https://www.irs.gov/statistics/soi-tax-stats-individual-income-tax-statistics-zip-code-data-soi). Date accessed Sept. 9, 2017.

**License/Terms of Use:** This dataset contains aggregate, non-personalized information that is owned and maintained by the federal government. A thorough review of the IRS.gov tax statistics section, IRS FOIA section and site privacy policy revealed no restrictions on its use.

**Description:** This data set includes detailed information about individual income tax returns in the United States, aggregated by U.S. ZIP Code. It allows a user to discover how American families in geographically diverse communities are earning income, getting taxed on that income and using credits and deductions to reduce their tax burden.  For each ZIP code, the data set includes information on adjusted gross income, investment income, Social Security benefits, use of alternative energy tax credits, child tax credits, foreign tax credits, mortgage interest deductions, student loan interest deductions, teacher expense deductions and much more.  By merging this data with other ZIP Code-level data from the U.S. Census Bureau -- race, education level, country of origin, et cetera -- and other sources there are an essentially unlimited number of hypotheses one could test.

**Potential Users:**
- Members of Congress and executive branch employees examining the impact of federal tax policy.
- Journalists and advocacy organization employees looking to critically examine federal policy.
- Businesses that appeal to specific income groups looking to open new locations.

**Three Questions:**
- As Congress and the Trump administration consider overhauling the nation’s tax code, some have called for changes to the mortgage interest deduction. Is the percentage of returns that take the mortgage interest deduction higher in ZIP Codes with a higher  average adjusted gross income?  
- The rise of the so-called “gig economy” has opened up more freelancing opportunities for U.S. workers. Did the percentage of tax filers paying the “self-employment tax” increase between 1999 and 2015?
- Has the cost of child care risen faster than inflation, as measured by the increase in the average child care tax credit taken between 1999 and 2015?

## New York City Restaurant Inspections

**Name:** Department of Health and Mental Hygiene New York City Restaurant Inspection Results

**Data Citation:** Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (NYC DOHMH). (2017). DOHMH New York City Restaurant Inspection Results [Data files, open data dictionary]. Retrieved from [https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/DOHMH-New-York-City-Restaurant-Inspection-Results/43nn-pn8j](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/DOHMH-New-York-City-Restaurant-Inspection-Results/43nn-pn8j). Date accessed Sept. 9, 2017.

**License/Terms of Use:** According to the DOHMH website and New York City’s OpenData website, the “license for this dataset is unspecified.”

**Description:** This dataset of nearly 400,000 records documents inspections of New York City restaurants between 2014 and 2017 (with sporadic records from earlier years), listing about 20,000 restaurants in total. Each record represents a single violation identified by a health department official during an inspection ( or an acknowledgement that no violations were found).  The data set includes fields on location, inspection date, cuisine type (“Chinese,” “Mexican”), the specific violation identified by the health inspector, the consumer-facing “letter grade” assigned to the restaurant, and other information.  The level of detail is striking, with information about the presence of roaches and vermin, illegal use of trans-fats, failure to display calorie information and much more.       

**Potential Users:**
- Restaurant patrons who wish to learn more about the eateries they visit, or software developers who wish to build tools for those patrons.
- Health department analysts looking at changes in violations over time and location.
- Cleaning companies who wish to identify restaurants that might hire them.  

**Three Questions:**
- Can we predict whether a restaurant is likely to be closed down by the health department based on the violations found at the first inspection after opening?
- Do restaurants in certain parts of the city have a larger problem with rats, mice and roaches than other parts of the city?
- Which types of cuisine are more likely to be cited by the health department and receive lower consumer-facing health grades?

## Global Terrorism Database

**Name:** Global Terrorism Database (GTD)

**Data Citation:** National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START). (2017). Global Terrorism Database [Data files, codebook, terms of use]. Retrieved from [https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd](https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd). Date accessed Sept. 9, 2017.

**License/Terms of Use:** Use of the GTD is governed by a detailed [“Terms of Use” document](http://apps.start.umd.edu/gtd/downloads/dataset/TermsofUse.pdf) that gives the users “non-exclusive, non-guaranteed right to search, browse and view.” It also demands that any information from the database be cited with an APA data citation.

**Description:** This dataset includes detailed information about terrorist attacks that took place between 1970 and 2016, as defined by a specific set of attack criteria used by the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START).  There is one record per incident. An attack is defined as an intentional act of violence (or threat of violence) by a non-state person or group that does two of the following three things: seeks a “political, economic, religious or social” goal; seeks to “coerce, intimidate or convey some other message to a larger audience...than the immediate victims"; and/or falls outside of “legitimate warfare activities.”   The dataset includes fields for date and time, a text summary, details on the three terrorism criteria, location, attack type (i.e. assassination, hijacking, kidnapping), weapons used, victim information, attacker information, and information about people killed and wounded. It provides a fairly thoughtful and comprehensive picture of terrorism incidents in the second half of the 20th century and the 21st century.

**Potential Users:**
- National security analysts looking to predict future terrorist attacks or identify emerging global hotspots.
- Policy makers interested in understanding global terrorism.  
- Journalists and historians looking to document the rise and fall of extremist groups.

**Three Questions:**
- Has there been an increase in the frequency of terrorist incidents targeting non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in the last two decades?
- What countries have seen significant changes in terrorist incidents since Sept. 11, 2001?
- How do terrorist attacks executed by ISIS/ISIL differ (in targets, frequency and weapons) differ from those executed by Al Qaeda?
